# HeartAttackAnalysisPrediction
Predicting heart attack using machine learning

This project explores the popular "Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset" from Kaggle using a simple approach. The main objective is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using data visualization techniques and apply machine learning algorithms for prediction purposes, comparing the results for learning purposes. Additionally, this project presents a discussion on the key findings and data used during this process.
Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA revealed that age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate achieved during exercise were all positively correlated with the target variable, while resting blood pressure was negatively correlated.
Machine Learning Models
Five distinct machine learning algorithms were tested, yielding satisfactory results overall. The most accurate model was identified as the Logistic Regression Model, exhibiting an accuracy of 88%.
Key Findings
Logistic regression was the most accurate model for predicting heart attack, with an accuracy of 88%.
Age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate achieved during exercise were all positively correlated with the target variable, while resting blood pressure was negatively correlated.
The dataset employed in this study contained a limited number of individuals and lacked information regarding prevalent diseases associated with heart attack.
The results presented here are not intended for clinical use but rather to show the implementation of machine learning algorithms.
